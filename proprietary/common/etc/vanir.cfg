### one pound (#) means the # can be removed to make the value after actually be set on boot... otherwise, the stock value is used
### two or more pounds (#...#) means the line is a comment like this one... meant for a human to read. If you remove all of the pounds, bad things might happen, and Nuclearmistake will make you feel bad if you ask why.


### Enable these tweaks
### (1=enabled, 0 or commented = disabled)
enableTweaks=1

### FREQUENCIES
### Available frequencies ON POPCORN KERNEL (these might change if you change your kernel... but why would you do that, anyways? :-P)
### (230000, 350000, 700000, 1060000, 1200000, 1350000, 1420000)

maxFreq=1200000
minFreq=350000
maxFreqScreenOff=700000



### CPU Governor
### If you don't know what it is, don't mess with it
### Governers available ON POPCORN (this will not reflect available governers if you change kernels)
### (pegasusq, ondemand, aggressive, interactive, gallimaufy, aggressivex, interactivex, gallimaufryx, performance)

scaleGov=interactive



### smartreflex (MPU=CPU, IVA=hardware media encoder, CORE=core)
### (1=enabled, 0=disabled)

srMPU=1
srIVA=1
srCORE=1



### GPU Overclock
### (0=stock, 1=vanir recommended, 2=max)

gpuOC=1



### Battery life extender 
### a.k.a. the percentage of battery at which your battery is considered full
### <<higher values may reduce your battery's lifespan>>
### (stock=96, vanir recommended=100)

BLX=100

### Force fast charge
### same effect as the statusbar toggle, but this is applied at boot
### (0=stock/disabled, 1=enabled)

#ffc=0



### Wireless Low Latency Mode
### Increases internets while, but reduces battery life (while on WiFi)
### (N=disabled/stock, Y=enabled)

#wll=Y


################## BEGIN SCREEN STUFF ##################

### OMAP Gamma
### Controls display contrast
### (recommended value=6)

OMAPgamma=6



### Gamma Offset
### Default value is nice, but this one is nicer. Uncomment to try it.
### (3 numbers, corresponding to RGB channels)

GammaOffset="-6 0 5"



### COLOR SAFETY
### removes limits on color multipliers
### (1=enabled/stock, 0=disabled/any multipliers allowed)

#ColorSafety=1



### COLOR MULTIPLIER
### this is what makes Morfic's Trinity Kernel, or Ezekeel's color presets on Imoseon's LeanKernel using Jakebite's LeanTweaks look like they do
### (3 numbers... in the 2000000000 department... corresponding to RGB channels)

#ColorMult="2000000000 2000000000 2000000000"


################## END SCREEN STUFF ##################


################## BEGIN SOUND STUFF ##################


### Volume boost
### Vanir's sound is loud... this can make it louderererer
### (0=stock/no boost, 1=slight boost, 2=moderate boost, 3=ultra boost)

#VolBoost=0



### High performance sound
### This makes the sound even gooderer... at the cost of some battery life.
### (0=stock/disabled, 1=unn tiss unn tiss unn tiss unn tiss)

#HighPerf=1


################## END SOUND STUFF ##################


### Force Override Leantweaks
### This will prevent conflicts related to both leantweaks (with leankernel of course) and 99vanir setting the same things... any value other than 0 will stop this entire script from running if leantweaks seems to be installed
### (1=enabled/default, 0=disabled)

#force_override_leantweaks=1
